/**
 * Vocabulary for the Diggy agent security policy layer.
 *
 * The policy layer sits *between* the model and the tool executors: before any
 * `ToolContext` method runs, {@link decide} is asked whether the call may
 * proceed. Everything here is plain data — no DOM, no `chrome`, no third-party
 * imports — so it runs identically in the extension service worker, the desktop
 * brain and Node tests.
 *
 * The contract-facing `PolicyDecision` / `PolicyVerdict` shapes live in
 * `@diggy/shared` (`contracts/action.ts`); this package stays dependency-free and
 * exports the internal `Decision` (`allow | confirm | deny`) that the act layer
 * adapts to them.
 */

 * - `write` — local, reversible side effects (fill without submit, reminders,
 *   notifications, avatar/speech). An outward *effect*, but recoverable.
 * - `irreversible` — cannot be undone once it leaves (send, submit, delete,
 *   purchase, pay). Always gated.
