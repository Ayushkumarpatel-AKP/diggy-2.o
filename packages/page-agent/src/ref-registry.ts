/**
 * Ref bookkeeping — the mechanism behind "never act on a wrong element".
 *
 * A snapshot hands out incrementing numeric refs and stamps each element with
 * {@link REF_ATTRIBUTE} = `"<generation>:<ref>"`. `resolve()` only succeeds when
 * the ref is known **and** the element is still connected **and** still carries
 * that exact token. Anything else is *stale*:
 *
 * - `unknown`  — the ref was never handed out (invented / from another run).
 * - `gone`     — the element is detached from the document.
 * - `replaced` — a different node now occupies that ref (re-render, or a newer
 *   snapshot reused the ref number), which is exactly when acting would be a
 *   mistake.
