/**
 * `@diggy/page-agent` — the **act layer** vocabulary.
 *
 * This package is the DOM half of the agent loop: it turns a live page into a
 * compact list of actionable elements ({@link PageSnapshot}) and executes
 * actions against them. It is written against the real DOM (content-script
 * first) but every function is pure enough to run under jsdom.
 *
 * Two hard rules shape the types:
 *
 * 1. **A secret is never leaked.** {@link SnapshotEntry.value} is
 *    {@link REDACTED_VALUE} for password inputs and vault-filled fields, so a
 *    model message can never echo a credential.
 * 2. **A ref is only valid for the snapshot that produced it.** A ref whose
 *    element is gone or replaced resolves to a *stale* error, never to a
 *    different element (see {@link ActionResult}).
 *
 * The contract-facing surface (`ActionAPI`, `ActionResult`, `Plan`) lives in
 * `@diggy/shared` (`contracts/action.ts`) and is implemented in
 * `action-api.ts`; the types here are the DOM-layer vocabulary.
